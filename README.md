WEPL a repl for the web
========================

WEPL is a simple {express,node}.js app whose sole purpose is to provide a playground for learning how to code that doesn't require knowing anything in advance.  The goal is to minimize the useless cognitive load just long enough to get an idea what you're doing.

Currently, it's got a lot of shortcomings (a central one of which is that the only interface is undocumented and requires that you url-encode javascript manually), but the technical infrastucture is pretty much all there.

An even loftier, potential aspiration, is to follow in the footsteps of [Light Table](http://app.kodowa.com/playground), which was inspired (as is WEPL, in part), by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s talk [Inventing on Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366).  (A talk, which, since you're the sort of person who reads to the third paragraph of README.md files on github, you should absolutely go watch.)
