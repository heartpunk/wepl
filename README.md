WEPL: a REPL for the web
========================

WEPL is a simple {express,node}.js app whose sole purpose is to provide a playground for learning how to code that doesn't require knowing anything in advance.  The goal is to minimize the useless cognitive load just long enough to get an idea what you're doing.

This is just the bare minimum, acceptable implementation.  It still needs a lot of work.  Check out the issues list if you want to help.  Pull requests gladly accepted.

A lofty aspiration of this project is to follow in the footsteps of [Light Table](http://app.kodowa.com/playground), which was inspired (as is WEPL, in part), by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s talk [Inventing on Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366).  (A talk, which, since you're the sort of person who reads to the third paragraph of README.md files on github, you should absolutely go watch.)
